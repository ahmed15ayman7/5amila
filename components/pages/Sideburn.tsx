          If you’re feeling a little bare in the sideburn department, you might want to take a trip to Turkey! Apparently, sideburn transplants are all the rage there, with more and more people getting in on the action every year. And why not? The process is surprisingly simple – just a quick jab of local anesthetic, and you’re good to go.
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6">
          The real kicker, though? Istanbul is the place to be for these bushy beauties. With low living costs and a plethora of hair professionals, there’s no better place to get your sideburns back in business. And trust us, these doctors know what they’re doing when it comes to hair restoration.

        <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6">
          Sure, the procedure can take up to three hours (or even longer if it’s going to be a tricky one), but the results? Oh, they’re worth it. Basically, they take hair from the back or sides of your scalp and transplant it onto your cheeks. Voila! Instant sideburns.

          <h4 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-4">1. Cause of Hair Loss</h4>
          <p>
            Suitability for a sideburn transplant will depend on the reasons for hair loss. Whether you have been experiencing symptoms of alopecia, such as traction, androgenic, or alopecia marginalis, or have other reasons for having hair transplanted to your sideburns, we can assess your suitability.
          </p>
          <h4 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-4">2. Donor Hair Density</h4>
          <p>
            You will need plenty of donor hair on your head to ensure we can successfully perform a sideburn transplant. This will be assessed during the consultation to manage the expectations you want to achieve. A lack of donor hair density means this procedure is not suitable.

          A sideburn hair transplant at Vera Clinic is achieved with the well-known FUE hair transplant method, ensuring you have the best looking, sharpest new sideburns. The process involves extracting hair follicles from a donor area and grafting them to the sides of your face. The procedure is minimally invasive and takes a few hours, with results being natural and integrated well with your existing hair.

        <p className="text-gray-600 mb-4">
          A sideburn hair transplant consultation is crucial to determine the ideal treatment plan. Discuss your expectations and desired sideburn type with your doctor, quit smoking and drinking at least one week before surgery, and avoid blood-thinning medication. You should also avoid herbal supplements one week before surgery and refrain from eating or drinking the night before.
