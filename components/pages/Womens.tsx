        <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2 text-blue-600">Why Turkey?</h3>
        <p className="text-gray-600">
          Turkey has become a global hub for hair restoration treatments due to its combination of high-quality healthcare and competitive pricing.

        <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2 text-green-600">The Procedure</h3>
        <p className="text-gray-600">
          Hair transplant procedures for women generally involve advanced techniques like Follicular Unit Extraction (FUE) and Direct Hair Implantation (DHI). These methods are minimally invasive and provide natural-looking results. FUE involves extracting individual hair follicles from a donor area and implanting them into the thinning or balding areas. DHI uses a specialized implanter tool to insert hair follicles directly into the recipient area without the need for pre-existing incisions.

        <p className="text-gray-600">
          Female hair loss can result from various factors, including hormonal changes, genetics, and medical conditions. Unlike male pattern baldness, which often results in a receding hairline or bald spots, women typically experience diffuse thinning across the scalp. Understanding the underlying cause of hair loss is crucial for determining the most effective treatment approach.

        <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2 text-orange-600">What to Expect After Hair Transplant?</h3>
        <p className="text-gray-600 mb-4">
          After a female hair transplant, patients can expect some initial swelling, redness, and mild discomfort in the donor and recipient areas. These are normal and should subside over time. Post-operative care includes avoiding strenuous activities, keeping the scalp clean, and following specific aftercare instructions provided by the surgeon.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-600 mb-4">
          Hair growth typically begins around 3 to 4 months post-surgery, with full results becoming evident after 9 to 12 months. During this period, the transplanted hair will gradually thicken and mature.

          <h4 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-4">1. Cause of Hair Loss</h4>
          <p>
            Those with certain conditions are eligible for a hair transplant in Turkey. These include Androgenetic alopecia, Traction alopecia, alopecia marginalis, and Trauma hair loss (scarring/burning). Some causes of hair loss can be stopped, for example, stress hair loss, imbalanced hormones, a vitamin deficiency, or poor haircare. That’s why we recommend having a detailed examination and blood test before coming to the clinic.
          </p>
          <h4 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-4">2. Donor Hair Density</h4>
          <p>
            Before we qualify you for a female hair loss transplant, we will need to assess your hair and check a few factors, including the donor site on the scalp. There must be enough hair on your scalp to extract a section for the hair transplant. This section will act as the donor, and we will transfer hair follicles to the problematic area from here. With sufficient donor hair density, a hair transplant may be successful. Still, we can assess your suitability for this and other treatments at a consultation.
