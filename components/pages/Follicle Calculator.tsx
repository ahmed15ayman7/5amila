        <p className="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-4">
          When comparing hair grafts amounts, no two people are the same, but the hair transplant procedure will follow the same rule. If you have extensive hair loss, you can expect to need a higher number of donor hair follicles to help achieve the results you want. Where one person may need a 1000 grafts hairline, another with a similar hair loss issue might require more. A 2300 grafts hair transplant will naturally take longer to perform than 1000 grafts, so procedure times can vary.
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-4">
          The number of grafts doesn't necessarily affect the naturalness of the results. For instance, a 2000 grafts transplant might look similar to a smaller 1000 grafts procedure if done effectively. The skill and expertise of the surgeons at our clinic make it hard to distinguish between different numbers of grafts when evaluating the results.

        <p className="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-4">
          At our clinic, we ensure that the right number of hair grafts is selected based on each individualâ€™s needs. Surgeons will recommend the optimal amount to achieve the best results. The hair graft calculator provides an estimate and may suggest a range, but the final number may vary slightly based on your specific case. If you're not suitable for a transplant, we will explain why.

        <p className="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-4">
          Unshaven hair transplant involves taking donor hair from the back of your head and transplanting it to the front, where hair loss has occurred. This method aims to provide a full head of hair without visible surgery scars. The donor area must be shaved before the procedure to ensure only healthy follicles are used.
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-4">
          This procedure is often used to treat male pattern baldness. The transplanted hair will grow as naturally as the existing hair on your scalp.

        <p className="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-4">
          The DHI (Direct Hair Implantation) system performs hair transplants without shaving the head. Hair follicles are extracted from the donor area and implanted into the recipient area using a micro-needling device. This method is virtually painless and causes less damage to surrounding tissues compared to traditional methods.
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-4">
          DHI uses fewer grafts, leading to higher patient satisfaction due to its precision and minimal tissue damage.

          Sapphire FUE (Follicular Unit Extraction) uses a sapphire blade to extract and implant hair follicles. This method improves hair density and quality and is suitable for both men and women. The procedure takes about four hours and involves making small incisions with a sapphire blade to minimize scarring.

          <h4 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">During the Procedure, 1 Graft Equals How Many Hairs?</h4>
          <p className="mb-4">
            The number of hairs per graft varies, with many people having 2 hairs per graft on average. For instance, a 3000 grafts transplant could mean approximately 6000 hairs. The actual number will be assessed during your consultation.

          <h4 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Is a Hair Transplant in Turkey with Unlimited Grafts Possible?</h4>
          <p className="mb-4">
            An unlimited number of hair grafts cannot be transplanted. The average person has about 5000-7000 grafts suitable for the procedure. During a consultation, we'll determine if there are enough healthy grafts available for your transplant.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-4">
            The most accurate way to determine the right number of grafts is through a consultation. Our calculator provides an estimate, but the final number will be decided based on a detailed assessment of your hair loss and other factors.
