      {/* Introduction */}
      <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6">
        Turkey has become a top destination for facial hair transplants due to its high-quality medical services, experienced surgeons, and affordable costs. Clinics in Turkey offer advanced techniques and have a track record of successful outcomes.
      </p>

      {/* Why Turkey? */}
      <section className="mb-6">
        <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2 text-blue-600">Why Turkey?</h3>
        <p className="text-gray-600">
          Turkey's healthcare system is well-regarded for its quality and affordability. The country has numerous experienced clinics specializing in hair transplants. Many of these clinics use the latest technology and techniques, providing excellent results at a fraction of the cost compared to other countries.

      {/* The Procedure */}
      <section className="mb-6">
        <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2 text-green-600">The Procedure</h3>
        <p className="text-gray-600">
          Facial hair transplants typically involve two main techniques: Follicular Unit Extraction (FUE) and Follicular Unit Transplantation (FUT). FUE is a minimally invasive method where individual hair follicles are extracted from a donor area and transplanted to the desired area. FUT involves removing a strip of skin with hair follicles from the donor area and then transplanting these follicles.

      {/* How Does FUE Hair Transplant Work? */}
      <section className="mb-6">
        <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2 text-purple-600">How Does FUE Hair Transplant Work?</h3>
        <p className="text-gray-600 mb-4">
          As previously mentioned, the FUE hair transplant comprises three stages: harvesting, incision, and implantation. Depending on the graft count, an FUE operation usually takes 6-8 hours. Each stage plays a crucial role in the overall success of the transplant and the naturalness of the final results. Additional factors contributing to a successful result include anterior hairline design, direction of implantation, and the use of appropriate follicular units in each location.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-600 mb-4">
          A detailed medical history is essential to grasp the patient’s overall health, pre-existing conditions, and potential risks for the planned procedure. Subsequently, a comprehensive examination should be conducted, and the patient’s expectations should be discussed. Understanding the patient’s expectations is essential for building a solid doctor-patient relationship, managing expectations, and ensuring that the patient’s goals align with what can realistically be achieved.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-600 mb-4">
          The process begins with shaving both the donor and recipient regions. The donor site is then sterilized using a disinfectant such as alcohol or iodine. Local anesthetics are injected into the donor site to ensure prolonged numbness. A local anesthetic ointment or a needle-free jet gun may be used to minimize discomfort. Once numbness is achieved, a tumescent solution is injected under the scalp to reduce bleeding and facilitate healthy graft extraction. Some surgeons may include adrenaline and corticosteroids in the solution to further reduce bleeding and swelling.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-600 mb-4">
          The extraction phase involves using a motorized micro punch to extract individual follicular units, a technique that eliminates the outdated "plug" look associated with older instruments. The harvested grafts are collected with micro forceps and stored in a cool, sterile solution until implantation.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-600 mb-4">
          The incision stage involves creating recipient incisions (or channels) for graft implantation. Sapphire blades are preferred for their precision and minimal tissue damage. The angle, depth, and spacing of incisions are critical for achieving a natural hair growth pattern. Adequate bleeding control is essential for a clear surgical field and precise incision creation.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-600">
          After the incision phase, the grafts are meticulously implanted into the pre-made channels. Single-hair grafts are placed at the front edge, while multi-hair grafts are positioned in the middle and toward the back for a natural distribution. The grafts are placed slightly above the surrounding skin for optimal growth.

      {/* What Is DHI Hair Transplant? */}
      <section className="mb-6">
        <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2 text-red-600">What Is DHI Hair Transplant?</h3>
        <p className="text-gray-600 mb-4">
          Direct Hair Implantation (DHI) is an alternative method where an implanter tool is used to both create recipient incisions and place the grafts simultaneously. This method eliminates the need for pre-existing incisions and offers a more precise implantation process. DHI is similar to the FUE technique, except for the channel creation step.

        <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2 text-orange-600">FUE Hair Transplant Before and After</h3>
        <p className="text-gray-600 mb-4">
          The success of an FUE hair transplant is evident in the before-and-after results. Patients typically experience significant improvements in hair density and coverage, with natural-looking outcomes that blend seamlessly with existing hair. It's important to follow post-operative care instructions for optimal results.

        <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2 text-teal-600">What to Expect After Hair Transplant?</h3>
        <p className="text-gray-600 mb-4">
          After a hair transplant procedure, patients can expect some initial swelling, redness, and mild discomfort in the donor and recipient areas. These are common and should gradually subside over the following days. It's crucial to follow the post-operative care instructions provided by your surgeon to ensure proper healing and optimal results.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-600 mb-4">
          Patients are advised to avoid strenuous activities and direct sun exposure for a few weeks. It's also important to keep the scalp clean and avoid touching or scratching the transplant area to prevent infection and ensure graft survival.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-600 mb-4">
          Hair growth typically starts around 3 to 4 months post-surgery, with full results visible after 9 to 12 months. During this time, the transplanted hair follicles will go through a growth cycle, and the hair will gradually thicken and mature.
